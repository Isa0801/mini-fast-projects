## TicTacToe
Playing TicTacToe alone is boring, that is why playing with freind is fun.
For anyone who is making TicTacToe from scracth, think about rendering object such as X and O,
based on the arrayMap which cotains where X/O are chosen. Also think about network desgin such as who is X player and O player,
are they chosen at random, and what shall you do after the game is over, do you switch sides for X and O player.
